# PlatePal: Machine Learning Grocery Companion

Personalize your grocery run using Machine Learning.

A Reinforcement Learning based recommendation system that takes in your postal code, fetches the latest deals from grocery stores nearby and curates a grocery list across four categories - carbs, proteins, dairy and fresh-produce all within the budget specified by the user. The model learns from itself by using a Q-Learning agent with an Epsilon greedy approach.
